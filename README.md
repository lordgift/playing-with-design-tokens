# playing-with-design-tokens
Try to use design tokens from designer then generate for development.


This example code initialize from style-dictionary basic. I focus to use on iOS, Android development. If you have the style-dictionary module installed globally, you can `cd` into this directory and run:
```bash
style-dictionary build
```
